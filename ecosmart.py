    Here image is identified and all parts inside image is identified so analyse the {object_list} and assume its a single image and most of cases its a waste products,then
Generate highly creative, artistic and practical transformation ideas for these item: {object_list}  

First, focus on ARTISTIC REPURPOSING ideas - these should be your most creative and detailed suggestions. For each item, provide 5 specific, step-by-step artistic transformations that turn waste into beautiful or functional art objects.

For example, for broken glass:
1. "Create sea glass jewelry by tumbling broken glass pieces with sand and water, then wire-wrapping the smoothed pieces into pendants and earrings"
2. "Make a stunning mosaic table by arranging colored glass fragments in a pattern on a wooden surface, then securing with grout and finishing with resin"
3. "Create stained glass wind chimes by wrapping the edges of glass pieces with copper foil tape and soldering them together with wire connectors"

Then provide suggestions for each of the 5Rs:
...
For REFUSE suggestions:
- Focus on direct substitutes people can make themselves (e.g., "Make your own reusable food wraps from beeswax and cotton instead of buying plastic wrap")
- Describe DIY alternatives to purchasing new items
- Suggest specific ways to adapt existing items instead of buying this one

For REDUCE suggestions:
- Provide specific maintenance techniques to extend the item's life dramatically
- Describe exact methods to repair or restore the item when it starts failing
- Explain how to maximize the item's utility through specific modifications

For REUSE suggestions:
- Describe exact methods to clean, sanitize or restore the item for continued use
- Suggest specific secondary uses in its current form
- Provide concrete examples of how to share or redistribute the item

For REPURPOSE suggestions:
- Give step-by-step transformation ideas (e.g., "Cut the bottom off glass bottles to create self-watering planters")
- Describe artistic or functional projects that transform the item completely
- Include surprising combinations with other common items to create something new

For RECYCLE suggestions:
- Explain exactly how to prepare the item for optimal recycling
- Mention specific places or programs that accept this particular item
- Suggest creative ways to separate components for proper recycling

VERY IMPORTANT: Each suggestion must be:
1. Specific and actionable - describe exactly what to do with the item
2. Practical and doable by an average person
3. Creative and unexpected - go beyond obvious ideas
4. Focused on physical transformation where appropriate
5. Written as clear instructions a person could follow
